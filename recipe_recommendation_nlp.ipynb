Gourmet first wrote about them in 1942, as a treat that hungry cowboys cooked for themselves., Calf fires are available frozen from Highland Country Farms (800-398-7803)., Cleaning fries (once they've been thawed) can be a little unsettling —but if you think about what you are doing, so can the preparation of any creature. Each fry is enclosed in a sac of skin with a small opening. Pull the opening apart with your fingers to reveal the tender, membrane-covered portion inside. Cut the skin away with a knife, leaving the membrane intact, then proceed with the recipe.}   \n",

              "64906  Animal fries, or testicles, have a mild flavor and delicate texture somewhat like sweetbreads. They are considered a seasonal delicacy in many parts of the world. Gourmet first wrote about them in 1942, as a treat that hungry cowboys cooked for themselves.;Calf fires are available frozen from Highland Country Farms (800-398-7803).;Cleaning fries (once they've been thawed) can be a little unsettling —but if you think about what you are doing, so can the preparation of any creature. Each fry is enclosed in a sac of skin with a small opening. Pull the opening apart with your fingers to reveal the tender, membrane-covered portion inside. Cut the skin away with a knife, leaving the membrane intact, then proceed with the recipe.   \n",

Let stand until bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Combine 5 cups flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast mixture and mix on medium-low speed, adding a little more flour or water, if needed, until a rough, sticky ball of dough forms, about 1 minute. Let rest 5 minutes, then mix on medium low until no longer sticky, about 1 more minute. Transfer the dough to an oiled surface and knead with oiled hands until smooth, about 10 times. Let rest 5 minutes, then knead briefly again and transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight. Divide the dough into 4 balls, dust with flour and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 2 hours before making the pizzas.\\nMake the sauce: Crush the tomatoes in a bowl using your hands. Stir in the olive oil, garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the oregano. Cover and let stand 2 hours. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a 12-to-14-inch round on individual sheets of parchment paper. Let rest 15 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the sauce. Spread a thin layer of sauce on each pizza, leaving a border. Top with one-quarter each of the mozzarella, parmesan, cherry peppers, soppressata and radicchio; drizzle with olive oil. Slide 1 pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone in the oven. Bake until the crust browns, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with oregano. Repeat to make 3 more pizzas. Photograph by Con Poulos   \n",

Whisk in the cream and milk and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble.\\nTransfer the cream mixture to a heatproof bowl and add the mint. Set the bowl over a bowl of ice water to cool the mixture down quickly and stir occasionally until cool; discard the mint after 5 minutes. (Don't steep the mint for too long or it will impart a grassy flavor; a quick steep while the cream cools will do.) Cover the mint cream and refrigerate about 4 hours, or until completely cold.\\nFreeze the mint cream in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions until frozen.\\nMeanwhile, place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, set it over a saucepan of simmering water and stir the chocolate until it has just melted. Remove from the heat and cool until the chocolate is barely warm and still fluid.\\nTransfer the gelato to a large bowl set over a bowl of ice. Working quickly, drizzle the melted chocolate into the gelato while whisking or stirring vigorously. The chocolate will flake apart as it hits the cold gelato, forming bits of chocolate throughout. If you prefer larger pieces of chocolate throughout the gelato, use a wooden spoon to slowly stir in the melted chocolate. Serve immediately, or transfer to a container and freeze until firm, 3 to 4 hours.\\nCurtis serves his homemade gelato between waffle cookies.\\nPhotograph by Ray Kachatorian   \n",

Add 2 teaspoons salt, the onion, thyme, oregano, bay leaves and peppercorns; cover and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the pork is tender, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer the pork to a plate and shred. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid; keep warm.\\nMeanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, 1 hour.\\nCombine the pork, cumin, 1/3 cup chili powder, the garlic, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, make the dough: Mix the masa harina, lard, 2 teaspoons salt, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 2 2/3 cups of the reserved cooking liquid in a bowl until combined.\\nDrain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread about 3 tablespoons of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.\\nSet a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down.

Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the water is absorbed, 12 to 14 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, grate 1 teaspoon orange zest, then juice all 3 oranges and the tangerines into a bowl. Sprinkle the sugar in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until dark amber, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the vinegar, citrus juices and zest, and the coriander. Return to medium heat and boil until thick, about 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter; keep warm.\\nSeason the scallops on one side with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the scallops seasoned-side down and sear until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes.\\nFluff the quinoa with a fork and divide among plates. Top with the scallops, drizzle with the citrus sauce and sprinkle with the parsley.\\nPhotograph by Antonis Achilleos   \n",
              "125149  Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the malted milk powder, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar; continue beating until stiff shiny peaks form. Set aside.\\nBeat the vegetable oil, egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl with the mixer on medium speed (no need to clean the beaters). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until incorporated. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and springs back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar and spread a large clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) on top. Invert a cooling rack onto the towel, then invert the cake onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Roll up the cake and towel together, starting from a long side to form a 17-inch-long roll. (You'll remove the towel later.) Set aside on the rack to cool completely.\\nMake the frosting: Combine the granulated sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. (Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush.) When the sugar has almost reached 240 degrees F, beat the egg and egg yolks in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the sugar syrup between the whisk and the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the bowl is cool to the touch. Remove the whisk and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add the butter and beat until thick and glossy. Combine the malted milk powder, vanilla and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl; beat into the frosting along with the nutmeg.\\nUnroll the cooled cake and spread with 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Gently reroll the cake (without the towel) and trim the ends. Cover with the remaining frosting; dust with cocoa powder.\\nPhotograph by Johnny Miller   \n",

Add 2 teaspoons salt, the onion, thyme, oregano, bay leaves and peppercorns; cover and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the pork is tender, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Transfer the pork to a plate and shred. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid; keep warm.\\nMeanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, 1 hour.\\nCombine the pork, cumin, 1/3 cup chili powder, the garlic, flour, sugar, vegetable oil and 1 cup of the reserved cooking liquid in a large skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 25 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, make the dough: Mix the masa harina, lard, 2 teaspoons salt, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 2 2/3 cups of the reserved cooking liquid in a bowl until combined.\\nDrain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread about 3 tablespoons of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.\\nSet a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, cover and steam until the dough is firm, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the steamer and let cool slightly before unwrapping.\\nPhotograph by Kat Teutsch</td>\n",

              "      <td>Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly brush an 11-by-17-inch rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil and line with parchment paper. Brush the parchment with oil and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Whisk the flour, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, the malted milk powder, cocoa powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar; continue beating until stiff shiny peaks form. Set aside.\\nBeat the vegetable oil, egg yolks and milk in a separate bowl with the mixer on medium speed (no need to clean the beaters). Reduce the speed to low and beat in the flour mixture until just combined. Fold one-third of the beaten egg whites into the batter, then fold in the rest until incorporated. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Bake until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and springs back when lightly pressed, 12 to 14 minutes. Dust the cake with the confectioners' sugar and spread a large clean kitchen towel (not terry cloth) on top. Invert a cooling rack onto the towel, then invert the cake onto the rack; peel off the parchment. Roll up the cake and towel together, starting from a long side to form a 17-inch-long roll. (You'll remove the towel later.) Set aside on the rack to cool completely.\\nMake the frosting: Combine the granulated sugar and 3/4 cup water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve. Cook over medium heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 240 degrees F, 20 to 30 minutes. (Brush any sugar crystals off the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush.) When the sugar has almost reached 240 degrees F, beat the egg and egg yolks in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment on high speed until thick and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and slowly pour in the sugar syrup between the whisk and the side of the bowl. Increase the speed to high and beat until the bowl is cool to the touch. Remove the whisk and fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. With the mixer on medium-high speed, gradually add the butter and beat until thick and glossy. Combine the malted milk powder, vanilla and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl; beat into the frosting along with the nutmeg.\\nUnroll the cooled cake and spread with 1 1/2 cups of the frosting. Gently reroll the cake (without the towel) and trim the ends. Cover with the remaining frosting; dust with cocoa powder.\\nPhotograph by Johnny Miller</td>\n",

Cut the tomatoes in 1/2 crosswise. Scoop out the centers leaving the outer thick flesh intact. Sprinkle the interior shells of the tomatoes with a couple pinches of salt and sugar, and invert them on a paper towel lined plate to drain until ready to stuff.\\nWith the grating attachment of a food processor or on the large-holed side of a box grater, grate the zucchini, and place it in a strainer. Toss the zucchini with 1 teaspoon salt and place the strainer over a bowl to catch the juices. Allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes.\\nIn a large heavy skillet, saute the shallots in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until they begin to caramelize. Meanwhile squeeze the zucchini to release as much water as possible.\\nTurn the heat up on the shallots, add the dry zucchini to the pan, and saute the zucchini with the shallots for 5 minutes.\\nAdd chopped parsley and thyme, and then toss the zucchini with the cheese, reserving 1/4 cup of the cheese for topping.\\nStuff the tomatoes with the filling, mounding it slightly, and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Place in tomato halves in ovenproof baking dish and broil them until the tops are golden. Serve hot.   \n",
              "125161  Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in shallot, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add bell peppers and red pepper flakes, and season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring until soft, about 5 minutes more. Stir in 1/2 of the basil.\\nMeanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until al dente, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain, and add to the pan with peppers. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Transfer to serving platter. If desired, remove garlic, and discard. Garnish with remaining basil and Parmesan. Serve immediately.\\nPreheat oven to 450 degrees F. Rub outside of pepper with olive oil, and place on a small baking sheet. Cook until skin begins to bubble and turn lightly brown in spots, 20 to 25 minutes, turning once after 10 minutes. Transfer to a container with a tight-fitting lid to steam for about 15 minutes. Remove stem and seeds; peel away skin, and discard.\\nIn the bowl of a food processor, puree pepper (there should be a generous 1/2 cup puree). Add flour and eggs. Process until dough forms a ball, about 15 seconds. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover with an inverted bowl or plastic wrap, and let rest 1 1/2 hours at room temperature or refrigerate overnight.\\nDivide dough into 8 pieces. Working with a few pieces at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered, flatten each portion of dough into a disk shape somewhat narrower than the machine's opening. Very lightly dust dough with flour. Feed through at machine's widest setting. (If dough pulls or tears when passing through machine, simply sprinkle a little more flour over dough, just before it's fed, to keep it from sticking. When finished, remove excess flour with a dry pastry brush.) As pasta sheet emerges, gently support it with palm, and guide it onto work surface. Fold sheet in half. Pass through a second time on the same setting to smooth dough and increase its elasticity.\\nThin dough by passing it through ever-finer settings, 2 passes on each setting, until sheets are almost translucent but do not tear. Pass the dough dthrdough until it has been passed through settings 1 through 4 (machine settings differ?some have as many as 10, while others have only 6).\\nSwitch to the cutter attachment, and pass each sheet through fettuccini cutter. Separate strands, and hang on a pasta rack to dry so that they do not stick together.\\nYield: about 1 1/2 pounds   \n",
